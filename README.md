# Project_1


This project aims to develop a system where user will be able to create the todo lists for daily tasks and mark the tasks as they are completed. 
The users tasks completion data will be evaluated based on the tasks completed through out week and a report will be generated to give feedback to the user based on 
the tasks completions. Users will be prompted with motivational quotes and some useful visual appreciations to boost their morals and inspire them to keep working
and try to improve every week.

The system currently is on very initial stages and will be developed as required. 
The idea behind this project was my personal experience of dealing with day-to-day life and implementing a system which will help everyone track their performance
in daily life be it work, personal habits,health,food related habits. I believe if someone is trying to track themselves on all levels their has to be 
a system which will help everyone to track their performance at the same time get insipired and motivated at the same time to continue on working and improving yourself.

The another reason to implement this system was to apply all the knowledge gained during the internship experience improve the coding skills 
and web application development skills.
