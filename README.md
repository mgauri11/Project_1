# Project_1


This project aims to develop a system where user will be able to create the todo lists for daily tasks and mark the tasks as they are completed. 
The users tasks completion data will be evaluated based on the tasks completed through out week and a report will be generated to give feedback to the user based on 
the tasks completions. Users will be prompted with motivational quotes and some useful visual appreciations to boost their morals and inspire them to keep working
and try to improve every week.

The system currently is on very initial stages and will be developed as required. 
The idea behind this project was my personal experience of dealing with day-to-day life and implementing a system which will help everyone track their performance
in daily life be it work, personal habits,health,food related habits. I believe if someone is trying to track themselves on all levels their has to be 
a system which will help everyone to track their performance at the same time get insipired and motivated to continue on working and improving oneself.

The another reason to implement this system was to apply all the knowledge gained during the internship experience improve the coding skills 
and web application development skills.

Functionalities implemented so far are as follows:

1) The user can register/login at the same time and then can enter the endpoint for creating and viewing the todolist with a option to create and edit the list.

2) The list added and login credentials are stored in the database (MongoDB).

3) The styling for now is not in place, I am working on implementing the web design using Blueprint React and React Bootstrap.

4) I am still working on the contact-us page, for now it is some random layout which I had thought initially(it will be updated).
